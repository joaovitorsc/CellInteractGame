🧬 Cell Interact: A Game for Learning Cellular Biology

Cell Interact is an interactive educational game developed for mobile devices that utilizes three-dimensional models to assist in teaching cell biology. The project aims to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as 2D textbook figures and microscopy, by allowing undergraduate students to interact directly with a 3D animal cell.

🎯 Objectives

Provide a complementary methodological tool for teaching cytology.
Facilitate the understanding of the internal structure and functions of cellular organelles.
Offer a playful and immersive learning experience through interactive Quiz mechanics.

🚀 Technologies Used

The project development integrated industry-standard tools to ensure interactivity and accessibility:
Game Engine: Unity 2021.3.16f (Game mechanics, interactive scenarios, and UI).
3D Modeling Software: Blender 2.8 (Creation and texturing of 3D organelles).
Image Editing: Adobe Photoshop (Used for the game's HUD/Heads-Up Display).
Target Platform: Android.

🎮 Features and Gameplay

The game follows a linear gameplay flow where the student must demonstrate knowledge about organelles:
3D Interaction: The player can rotate the cell by sliding their finger on the smartphone screen to locate structures.
Quiz System: Questions are randomly selected by the system.
Response Mechanic: To answer, the player must touch the correct organelle on the 3D model and hold the button for one second to confirm.
Assessment: After 11 questions, the system calculates performance. The student is "approved" if they achieve 7 or more correct answers.

📊 Results and Validation
Tests conducted with a group of 12 Biology undergraduate students demonstrated the tool's potential (on a scale of 1 to 5):
Ease of interacting with the 3D cell: Average 4.0.
Potential to assist in teaching cytology: Average 4.8.
Representation of organelles: Average 4.7.

🛠️ Roadmap (Future Work)
The project is currently under development, with the following improvements planned:
[ ] Implementation of the plant cell.
[ ] Expansion of the number of 3D-represented organelles.
[ ] Increasing the complexity of challenges.
[ ] Inclusion of Augmented Reality (AR) support.
